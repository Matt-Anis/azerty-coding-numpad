# AZERTY Numpad Coding Remap

## Overview

This AutoHotkey script remaps the numpad keys on an AZERTY keyboard to commonly used coding symbols and useful shortcuts. The goal is to make coding more efficient by allowing the right hand to access frequently used symbols and commands without relying on awkward key combinations or dead keys.

The script also includes convenient shortcuts for undo, redo, and a reference menu to display the current numpad mapping.

## Features

- Remap numpad keys to coding symbols commonly used in programming:
  - { } [ ] ( ) | \ ; . ` ? %
- Ctrl + Numpad shortcuts for closing brackets and redo
- Toggle the script on and off with F1
- View a reference guide for all mappings with Ctrl + F1
- Designed specifically to improve coding efficiency on AZERTY keyboards

## Installation

1. Install AutoHotkey from [https://www.autohotkey.com/](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Save the `.ahk` script anywhere on your computer

## Usage

1. Double-click the `.ahk` script to run it
2. Ensure NumLock is on
3. Use the numpad keys according to the mapping:
  - Numpad0: ;
  - NumpadDot: .
  - Numpad1: {
  - Numpad2: [
  - Numpad3: (
  - Numpad4: |
  - Numpad5: `
  - Numpad6: \
  - Numpad7: ?
  - Numpad8: %
  - Numpad9: Ctrl + Z (Undo)
  - Ctrl + Numpad1: } (closing brace)
  - Ctrl + Numpad2: ] (closing bracket)
  - Ctrl + Numpad3: ) (closing parenthesis)
  - Ctrl + Numpad9: Ctrl + Shift + Z (Redo)
4. Press F1 to suspend/resume the script
5. Press Ctrl + F1 to view the reference guide

## Motivation

Coding on AZERTY keyboards can be inefficient due to the placement of special characters and the presence of dead keys. This script was created to streamline coding on AZERTY layouts, reduce finger strain, and improve workflow efficiency for daily programming tasks.
